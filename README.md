# Experiment-5

Aim

The aim of the provided C++ code is to demonstrate the use of conditional statements (if-else ladder, nested if, and switch-case) in a programming context.

Theory

if-else Ladder An if-else ladder is a series of if statements that are used to execute different blocks of code based on multiple conditions. It helps in choosing one block of code among many based on boolean expressions:

Nested if Statements Nested if statements are used to further evaluate conditions within an already established if or else block

switch-case The switch-case statement allows execution of code blocks based on the value of a variable. It provides an alternative to multiple if-else statements:
